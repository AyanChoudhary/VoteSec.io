<b>Votesec.io</b> will be a completely automated voting API based on Azure Blockchain that means to serve as a realiable platform for conducting secure online polls/elections.

The primary asset of votesec.io is the assurance of complete anonymity. No data concerning the voters is stored in a way that can be traced back to the individual, at any point during the process. This, coupled with the innate security of Azure Blockchain creates a polling environment that ensures the privacy of everyone involved under all possible circumstances. 

Votesec keeps no records of who voted and who didn't, let alone "who voted for who" while still filtering all user input to ensure no one votes more than once and allowing regional voting patterns to be made publicly available.

Also each poll can be configured to use a custom unique identifier, characteristic to each voter. Meaning that Adhaar card numbers would be sufficient for citizens to log in and cast their votes, eliminating the need for voter registration. All Indian citizens above the age of 18 will automatically be recognized as valid voters and enabled to vote, unless specified otherwise by the conducting body.

Another major aspect of votesec is the flexibililty it offers. Our vision for the final product is for it to be a lightweight API that can be utilized by an entity as small as an organization with populace of less than a hundred people, to the Lok Sabha elections with a voter base of more than 800 million people. All features of the api, let alone the barebones voting and candidate registration mechanism could be made optional, allowing the conducting body a great deal of control over the balance between functionality and the Ether cost for the poll.
